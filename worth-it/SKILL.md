name: worth-it
description: Judge whether a planned feature or refactor is worth building — whether the payoff justifies the cost and actually moves a needle that matters. Judges benefit against cost across the constituencies a change can serve (end-user UX, human operator experience, codebase maintainability/durability, contributor velocity, business/strategic obligation), discounts benefit that is asserted but unmeasured, nets a gain on one front against the cost it adds on another, and weighs the whole thing against the do-nothing baseline, the timing window, and the next-best use of the same effort. Trigger when the user asks "is this worth doing/building," "is it worth it," "is this worthwhile," "does this move the needle," "what's the payoff/ROI," "should we even bother," is weighing whether a feature or refactor earns its place, or hands over a plan doc whose open question is its *value* rather than its engineering or its risk. Assumes the frame is already right (that is take-a-step-back); it leans on blast-radius and iron-triangle to price the cost and reversibility of a candidate path, then weighs that cost against the benefit it scores — the term those skills leave unscored. Skip when the change is obviously worth it and cheap, or when the open question is HOW to build it well (swe) rather than WHETHER to build it at all.

# Worth It

Price the benefit before you spend the effort. Most plans get sized for cost and reviewed for craft, then built on an *assumed* payoff nobody scored.

A value lens for a **feature or refactor under consideration** — a "should we build this" doc, a backlog item, a refactor someone is itching to start. The sibling skills price the cost (blast-radius), the traded corner (iron-triangle), and the engineering discipline (swe); none of them score the *benefit*. This one does, and it answers exactly one question: **is the payoff worth the cost — and is the payoff even real?** It is not a yes-machine. A clean "not worth it" or "not yet, measure first" is the point as often as a green light.

## The core read

> **Worth ~ (Impact x Reach x Confidence) / Cost — netted across fronts, against the do-nothing baseline.**

Not a calculator — a discipline: the symbols order the reasoning, they don't resolve to a number. Don't total made-up values; this is ordinal judgement (bigger / smaller, surer / shakier), not arithmetic. Each term is a question the plan usually leaves implicit:

- **Impact** — how far does the needle actually move? Not "it helps," but the size of the move.
- **Reach** — for how many, how often? A small win hit a hundred times a day beats a big win nobody reaches.
- **Confidence** — is the payoff *measured*, or asserted? An unmeasured benefit is weighted well under one, never at face value.
- **Cost** — the build effort *plus* the carrying cost it adds forever. Every feature is a permanent liability.
- **Netted across fronts** — a gain on one constituency is not free if it taxes another. Net them; don't OR them.
- **Do-nothing baseline** — what the status quo costs if you ship nothing. Some refactors are worth it only because decay is the alternative; some features solve a non-problem the baseline already handles.
- **Timing** — is there a window? A deadline, an expiring opportunity, or a do-nothing cost that compounds the longer you wait can flip a marginal call. Urgency raises the cost of *waiting*, it does not inflate the benefit — keep them separate.

## The five constituencies

A change usually moves a needle for one or more of these. Name *which* — "it's better" without a constituency is unscored. The list aims to be exhaustive about *who* benefits; a change that serves none of them is itself the finding.

1. **End-user UX** — the person using the product feels it: faster, clearer, fewer steps, less pain.
2. **Operator experience** — the human running the system: diagnosis, recovery, day-to-day toil, on-call load.
3. **Maintainability & durability** — the codebase itself: less surface to break, longer useful life, fewer ways to rot.
4. **Contributor velocity** — the next developer: how fast and safely the *next* change lands. Distinct from #3 — clean code the team can't move through fast still fails this.
5. **Business / strategic** — the organization: revenue protected or won, a contractual or regulatory obligation met, a competitive window held, a concrete risk avoided. The benefit here often *is* the do-nothing cost — the deal lost, the fine, the churn — rather than anything a user touches.

The two fronts an operator usually names first are #1 and #3. The skill's job is to also surface #2, #4, and #5, and to **net a forward move on one against a backward move on another**: a UX win that adds a subsystem to maintain is a UX gain *and* a maintainability tax — score both, then decide if the net clears.

## The four tests

Each test is a lens on the change. A plan passes a test by answering it with a *fact*, not a hope.

### 1. Needle — which front moves, and by how much?

- [ ] The moved constituency is named — one of the five above (UX / operator / maintainability / contributor / business), not left as a generic "better."
- [ ] The *size* of the move is stated, not just its direction — "cuts checkout from 5 taps to 2," not "improves checkout."
- [ ] Any front the change moves **backward** is named in the same breath — the new dependency, the added subsystem, the surface that now needs tending.
- [ ] The two fronts are **netted**, not OR'd: a gain on one that is cancelled by a cost on another is a wash, and the plan says so.

### 2. Reach — for whom, how often?

- [ ] The population is sized — "every API request," "the 15% of users who open settings," "the 4 people who run the deploy."
- [ ] The frequency is named — once ever, every release, every incident, every page load. Magnitude without frequency overstates a rare win.
- [ ] A benefit that reaches almost no one is flagged even when its per-event impact is large.
- [ ] **Small population, high frequency still clears.** Reach is population *times* frequency — a daily-friction win for the 3 people who touch that code every day can outrank a one-time win for thousands. Don't kill an operator or contributor refactor just because few people see it; weigh how often they hit it.

### 3. Confidence — measured or asserted?

- [ ] The payoff is tagged **measured** (there is a number), **proxied** (a reasonable stand-in exists), or **asserted** (someone believes it).
- [ ] An *asserted* benefit on a **Costly or One-way door** build is the headline finding — the verdict becomes **Not yet, measure first**, and the cheapest measurement is named. (On an Easy, reversible build, just try it — measuring would cost more than the build.)
- [ ] **Mandatory work skips the measure-first gate.** When the driver is compliance, security, a contract, or competitive table-stakes (constituency #5), the benefit *is* the penalty avoided — the fine, the breach, the lost deal — not a number to capture. Verdict: **Worth it — required**, not *measure first*. Scope can still be questioned; the *whether* cannot.
- [ ] Predicted and observed are kept separate — "this will cut load 40%" is a hypothesis to test, never evidence the build is worth it. (Borrows swe's Proof discipline: don't launder a projection as a result.)

### 4. Price — at what cost, instead of what?

- [ ] Build cost is sized (defer the detailed sizing to **blast-radius**; this test only requires the plan *carry* a number).
- [ ] **Carrying cost** is named — the permanent maintenance, the new failure modes, the thing on-call now has to know. Build cost is one-time; carrying cost is forever.
- [ ] **Reversibility** is read on the shared scale — **Easy / Costly / One-way door** (defer the read to **blast-radius**; if it hasn't run, gut-check it: can you undo this in an afternoon, a sprint, or never?) — because it sets how far an *asserted* benefit is allowed to ride: an Easy build can be tried on a hunch, a One-way door cannot.
- [ ] The **counterfactual** is stated — what the same effort would buy if spent on the next item instead. Worth is relative, not absolute.
- [ ] The **do-nothing cost** is stated — what the status quo actually costs over the next N months. If it is lower than the build, the honest verdict is *not worth it*.

## The cheaper-version lever

The most valuable output is rarely yes/no — it is **"the full thing isn't worth it, but the 20% that delivers 80% of the needle is."** Before any verdict, ask whether a smaller version captures most of the Impact x Reach at a fraction of the Cost. Scope is the release valve here exactly as it is in iron-triangle: the cheap slice that moves the needle usually beats the complete build that moves it slightly further for ten times the carrying cost.

## How this differs from the sibling skills

- **worth-it** — "Is the payoff worth the cost, and is the payoff real?" Scores the *benefit* the others leave unscored, against cost.
- **take-a-step-back** — "Is this the *right problem* at all?" Challenges the frame *before* there is a benefit to price. If the frame is wrong, worth-it is scoring the wrong thing — hand back to it.
- **iron-triangle** — "Which of speed / cost / quality am I trading?" Prices a path already chosen on three axes. worth-it asks whether to walk the path at all.
- **blast-radius** — "How big and how reversible is this path?" Sizes the cost. worth-it *consumes* that as the denominator and weighs benefit against it.
- **swe** — "Is the *plan* engineered well?" Judges the build's discipline (minimal / diagnosable / blast / proof). worth-it judges whether the build should exist. Complementary: swe grades the *how*, worth-it grades the *whether*.
- **baseline-spec** — when worth-it returns **Not yet, measure first**, this is the handoff: it turns the asserted benefit into a metric, oracle, and baseline so the value question can be answered with a number next time.

Reach for worth-it the moment the open question is *value* — should this be built — rather than risk, craft, or framing.

## Output format

Lead with the verdict in one line; the load-bearing reason rides with it. Then the scorecard, then the lever and the next move. A clear call gets two lines, not a manufactured analysis.

**Verdict:** **Worth it** · **Marginal** · **Not worth it** · **Not yet, measure first** — [one sentence: the reason that carries the call].

**Scorecard:**

| Test | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Needle | [front(s) moved + size; any front moved backward] |
| Reach | [population x frequency] |
| Confidence | [measured / proxied / asserted] |
| Price | [build cost + carrying cost + what the effort displaces] |
| Do-nothing | [what the status quo costs over the next N months — the counterweight the build must beat] |
| Reversibility | [Easy / Costly / One-way door — defers to blast-radius, or gut-check: undo in an afternoon / a sprint / never] |

Keep every scorecard cell to one or two sentences — a cell that swells into a paragraph or a bulleted list breaks the table and buries the read.

**Cheaper version:** [the 20% slice that captures most of the needle, or "none — it's all-or-nothing because ___"].

**Do next:** [the single move — usually "ship the cheap slice," "measure X before committing," or "build it, the net is clearly positive"].

Verdict guide: **Worth it** (net benefit clearly clears cost; both fronts non-negative or the backward one is named and accepted) · **Marginal** (not worth it *as written*, but worth a cheaper slice, or worth it only if a named assumption holds — say which; never read it as "barely worth building as-is") · **Not worth it** (do-nothing cost is lower, reach is near-zero, or the carrying cost outlives the win) · **Not yet, measure first** (the benefit is asserted on a Costly or One-way build — the value can't be judged until it's measured; an Easy build just gets tried instead).

## Principles

**Score the benefit, not just the cost.** The whole reason this skill exists is that the suite already prices cost five ways and never scores payoff. Refuse to let "it'll be better" pass as a benefit.

**Unmeasured benefit is discounted, not assumed.** A confident assertion is not a measurement. On an Easy, reversible build, proceed anyway; on a Costly or One-way door, the honest verdict is *measure first*.

**Carrying cost is forever; build cost is once.** The permanent maintenance, the new failure mode, the thing on-call must now know — these outlast the build and often outweigh it. Price the liability, not just the labor.

**Net the fronts; don't OR them.** A UX win that taxes maintainability has to clear *both* — or name which front it sacrifices and why that's acceptable. A change that moves one needle forward and another backward by the same amount is a wash dressed as progress.

**The do-nothing baseline is a real option.** The status quo has a cost; sometimes it's lower than the fix. "Solving a non-problem" is the most common way a plausible plan is not worth it.

**Reach for the cheaper version before the verdict.** The best result is usually not no — it's the 20% slice that moves the needle for a tenth of the cost. Scope is the release valve.

**Don't manufacture doubt.** A change that is clearly worth it and cheap gets "ship it" in two lines. The lens prices value honestly in both directions — it is not a bias toward caution any more than toward building.

## Example — a feature whose payoff is assumed

Input (abridged):

> **Build an in-app notification center.** A bell icon with unread counts, full history, and per-type preferences, so users stop missing important updates. Roughly three weeks. It'll meaningfully improve the UX.

Output:

> **Verdict:** **Marginal** — a full notification subsystem is a permanent carrying cost for a needle that the existing email already moves; the cheap slice captures most of it.
>
> **Scorecard:**
>
> | Test | Read |
> | --- | --- |
> | Needle | UX forward (users miss fewer updates) — but maintainability **backward**: a new subsystem (storage, real-time, preferences) to own and page on, forever. |
> | Reach | Unknown — no data on how many users miss updates today, or whether they'd check a bell over the email they already get. |
> | Confidence | **Asserted.** "Meaningfully improve the UX" has no number behind it; the email channel already covers the stated problem. |
> | Price | ~3 weeks build + indefinite carrying cost; displaces the billing-bug backlog. |
> | Do-nothing | Users keep getting the existing emails — modest ongoing cost, not zero. The build must beat *that*, not zero. |
> | Reversibility | Costly — once support flows and user habits depend on the bell, ripping it out is its own project. |
>
> **Cheaper version:** A single "what's new since you left" panel on login surfaces the 2-3 missed items at ~2 days, no new subsystem, no real-time, no preferences.
>
> **Do next:** Ship the login panel and instrument it — if click-through proves users want more, *then* the full center has a measured benefit to justify it. Until then the three-week build is buying an asserted gain.

## Counter-example — clearly worth it, no analysis needed

Input (abridged): "Adding request IDs and structured logging to the API before the next release — about a day's work."

Output:

> **Verdict:** **Worth it** — two needles forward (operator and durability), nothing moved backward, cost of a day. Ship it; no scorecard needed.
>
> A change this cheap with two fronts forward and zero traded is the calibration floor — the kind worth-it should green-light in one line. Walking the full scorecard here would be the regression, not the diligence: the skill prices value to *find* the hard calls, not to ceremony the easy ones.

## What success looks like

The operator sees, before spending the effort, whether the payoff is real and big enough — the subsystem whose benefit was never measured, the refactor that only halts decay, the feature whose cheap 20% would have done the job. The best outcome is not a verdict at all but a *reframe of the build*: smaller, measured, and worth it — instead of large, assumed, and shipped on faith.
